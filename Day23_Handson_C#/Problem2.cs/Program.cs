/*Level - 1 Problem 2: Asynchronous File Logger
Scenario:
An application writes logs to a file whenever an event occurs. Writing logs synchronously can slow down the application. Asynchronous file writing improves performance.

Requirements:
-Create an asynchronous method WriteLogAsync(string message).
- The method should simulate file writing using Task.Delay().
- Call this method multiple times to simulate logging different events.

Technical Constraints:
-Use async and await keywords.
- Use Task.Delay() to simulate file I/O.
- Use a console application.

Expectations:
-Logs should be written asynchronously.
- The main thread should remain responsive while logging operations occur.

Learning Outcome:
Students will learn how asynchronous operations improve performance when dealing with I/O operations.
