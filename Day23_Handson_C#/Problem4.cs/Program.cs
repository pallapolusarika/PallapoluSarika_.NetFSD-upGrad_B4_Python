/*Level - 2 Problem 2: Debugging Incorrect Discount Calculation
Scenario
A retail application calculates the final price of products after applying a discount. Recently, users reported that the final price shown by the application is incorrect. The development team needs to debug the application to identify where the incorrect calculation is happening.
Requirements
•	Create a console application that calculates the final product price.
•	The program should accept:
o Product Name
o	Product Price
o	Discount Percentage
•	The final price should be calculated using the formula:
FinalPrice = Price − (Price × Discount / 100)
•	Use debugging tools to verify that the calculation is correct.
•	Place breakpoints and inspect variable values during execution.
Technical Constraints
•	Use Visual Studio Debugging Tools.
•	Use breakpoints, step over, step into, and watch window.
•	Implement the solution using a.NET console application.
Expectations
•	Students should run the program in debug mode.
•	They should track variable values and confirm that the discount calculation is correct.
•	If incorrect results appear, students should identify the faulty logic.
Learning Outcome
Students will learn how to:
•	Use breakpoints effectively.
•	Inspect variable values during program execution.
•	Identify logical errors using debugging techniques.*/
