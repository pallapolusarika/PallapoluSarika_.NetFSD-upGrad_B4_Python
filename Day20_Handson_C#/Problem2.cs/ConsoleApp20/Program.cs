/*Level - 2 Problem 1: Bank Withdrawal System with Custom Exception
Scenario:
A bank wants to implement a withdrawal system that throws a custom exception when a customer attempts to withdraw more money than available in their account.
Requirements:
1.Create a class BankAccount with a private field balance.
2.	Create a method Withdraw(double amount).
3.	Create a custom exception class InsufficientBalanceException.
4.Throw the custom exception if the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance.
5.	Handle the exception in the main program using try-catch.
6.Ensure proper cleanup using a finally block.
Technical Constraints:
•	Use custom exception classes by inheriting from Exception.
•	Implement error propagation by throwing exceptions from methods.
•	Handle exceptions in the calling method.
Expectations:
•	Demonstrate creation and usage of custom exceptions.
•	Implement proper exception handling in calling code.
•	Display user-friendly error messages.
Learning Outcome:
•	Learn how to create custom exceptions.
•	Understand throw and error propagation.
•	Apply structured exception handling in real - world scenarios.
Sample Input:
Balance = 3000
 Withdraw = 5000
Sample Output:
Error: Withdrawal amount exceeds available balance*/
