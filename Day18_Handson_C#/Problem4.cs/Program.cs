/*Level - 2 Problem 3: Employee Salary Calculator
Scenario:
A company wants to calculate employee salaries using inheritance.All employees have a base salary, but different roles calculate bonuses differently.
Requirements:
1.Create a base class Employee with Name and BaseSalary properties.
2. Create derived classes Manager and Developer.
3. Override a virtual method CalculateSalary().
4. Manager gets 20% bonus, Developer gets 10% bonus.
Technical Constraints:
• Use inheritance and method overriding.
• Apply polymorphism using base class reference.
• Use properties for salary details.
Expectations:
• Demonstrate runtime polymorphism.
• Avoid code duplication.
• Display final calculated salary.
Learning Outcome:
• Understand inheritance hierarchy.
• Implement polymorphism using virtual and override.
• Write reusable and extensible code.
Sample Input: 
BaseSalary = 50000
Sample Output: 
Manager Salary = 60000, Developer Salary = 55000*/

using System;

class Employee
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double BaseSalary { get; set; }

    public virtual double CalculateSalary()
    {
        return BaseSalary;
    }
}

class Manager : Employee
{
    public override double CalculateSalary()
    {
        return BaseSalary + (BaseSalary * 0.20);
    }
}

class Developer : Employee
{
    public override double CalculateSalary()
    {
        return BaseSalary + (BaseSalary * 0.10);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.Write("Enter Base Salary: ");
        double baseSalary = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());

        Employee emp;

        emp = new Manager();
        emp.BaseSalary = baseSalary;
        Console.WriteLine("Manager Salary = " + emp.CalculateSalary());

        emp = new Developer();
        emp.BaseSalary = baseSalary;
        Console.WriteLine("Developer Salary = " + emp.CalculateSalary());
    }
}
